Both at the workshop and for a few months following it, you will be part of a team that is advised by one of our experienced mentors.</p> <p>Registration is now closed for the State Authorization Compliance Workshop.</p> <p>With lead experts with hands-on knowledge, you will gain the expertise to:</p> <ul> <li>Create a game plan to obtain and maintain state authorization for your unique institution;</li> <li>Interpret state statutes, state regulations, and administrative code regarding the authorization of distance education;</li> <li>Develop effective strategies to communicate key information to states and to administrators at your institution;</li> <li>Obtain, manage, and organize the data essential to the achievement of state authorization for your institution.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, each participant will be paired with a <a href=""/initiatives/state-authorization-network/mentors"" target=""_blank"">mentor</a>. The mentor will hold group discussions at the workshop to answer more in-depth and institution specific questions. After the workshop concludes, the mentor will host three conference calls with the group over a period of three months to continue the learning experience.</p> <h2>Who Should Attend:</h2> <p>Professionals who manage the state authorization, regulations, and federal updates at educational institutions. This workshop focuses on developing those participants who are newer to the role of being an authorization compliance officer.</p> <p><strong>Not quite an expert &ndash; but not a novice either?</strong><br /> We have room for you at the workshop! We will be setting aside one mentor group for those participants who have more experience than a newbie. In a pre-workshop survey, we will be asking participants to indicate how much experience each person has and set mentor groups accordingly.</p> <p>WCET&#39;s State Authorization Network (SAN) is based on the philosophy: &quot;Expecting each institution to navigate authorization regulations in every state is highly inefficient.

If so, the WCET State Authorization Compliance Workshop may be the answer!</p> <p><a href=""http://www.franklin.edu/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Franklin University logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Franklin-University-logo-stacked.jpg"" style=""float:left; height:53px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:150px"" /></a>WCET is pleased to partner with Franklin University (Columbus, Ohio) to bring together experts in the field of state authorization to educate you on the intricacies of authorization. The two-day workshop will provide detailed, up-to-date information designed to help your institution manage the complexities of state authorizations. Both at the workshop and for a few months following it, you will be part of a team that is advised by one of our experienced mentors.</p> <p>With lead experts with hands-on knowledge, you will gain the expertise to:</p> <ul> <li>Create a game plan to obtain and maintain state authorization for your unique institution;</li> <li>Interpret state statutes, state regulations, and administrative code regarding the authorization of distance education;</li> <li>Develop effective strategies to communicate key information to states and to administrators at your institution;</li> <li>Obtain, manage, and organize the data essential to the achievement of state authorization for your institution.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, each participant will be paired with a <a href=""/initiatives/state-authorization-network/mentors"" target=""_blank"">mentor</a>. The mentor will hold group discussions at the workshop to answer more in-depth and institution specific questions. After the workshop concludes, the mentor will host three conference calls with the group over a period of three months to continue the learning experience.</p> <h2>Who Should Attend:</h2> <p>Professionals who manage the state authorization, regulations, and federal updates at educational institutions. This workshop focuses on developing those participants who are newer to the role of being an authorization compliance officer.</p> <p><strong>Not quite an expert &ndash; but not a novice either?</strong><br /> We have room for you at the workshop! We will be setting aside one mentor group for those participants who have more experience than a newbie. In a pre-workshop survey, we will be asking participants to indicate how much experience each person has and set mentor groups accordingly.</p> <p>WCET&#39;s State Authorization Network (SAN) is based on the philosophy: &quot;Expecting each institution to navigate authorization regulations in every state is highly inefficient. Working cooperatively, institutions can share the burden.&quot; See the SAN website for a list of <a href=""/initiatives/state-authorization-network/participants"" target=""_blank"">WCET SAN members</a>.</p> <h2>Workshop Location Information:</h2> <p><img alt=""Photo of the Georgia Tech Center"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/places/GA-Tech-Center-SAN-Workshop-Atlanta.jpg"" style=""float:left; height:100px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:150px"" /></p> <p>The SAN Workshop will be held at the Georgia Tech Global Learning Center (84 5th Street, NW) located in Atlanta, Georgia.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Hotel Information:</h2> <p><a href=""http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=WCET%20State%20Authorization%20Compliance%20Workshop-%20Attendees%5Eatlbd%60wcewcea%60149.00%60USD%60false%603/1/15%603/4/15%602/13/15&amp;app=resvlink&amp;stop_mobi=yes"">Renaissance Midtown Atlanta Hotel</a> (866 W.

132,Bringing a Campus Experience to Online Students,/events/webcasts/campus-experience-to-online-students,"<p>Distance learning programs often face a challenge with student engagement and retention of online learners. Many of the reasons that students choose distance learning are also the reasons that students do not persist in online courses. In order for distance learning programs to provide the &quot;college experience&quot; that many of these students need to encourage their continued education, we must deliver engaging courses, but also present a co-curricular experience to them on their own virtual turf. By using more open course content in online courses and developing a comprehensive social media program to reach students where we know they spend time outside of class, we have a better chance of retaining them.</p> <p><strong>Resources:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/webcasts/2014/Campus-Experience-Chat-Log.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Chat Log</strong></a></li> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/webcasts/2014/Campus-Experience-FinalQA.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Questions &amp; Answers from the Webcast</strong></a></li> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/webcasts/2014/Campus-Experience-Slides.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Presentation Slides</strong></a></li> <li><a href=""http://youtu.be/gxHM_THOJqk"" target=""_blank""><strong>Recorded Webcast</strong></a></li> </ul> <p>This presentation was one of the most highly rated sessions at the WCET Annual Meeting and we are pleased to have William Preston Davis present via a webcast format to the broader WCET Community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/gxHM_THOJqk?rel=0"" width=""420""></iframe></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Presenter</h2> <p><img alt=""William Preston Davis"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Davis-WilliamPreston.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>William Preston Davis</strong></li> <li><em>Director of Instructional Services,</em></li> <li><em>Northern Virginia Community College</em></li> </ul> <p><img alt=""Katie Aimone"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Aimone-Katie.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Katie Aimone</strong></li> <li><em>Orientation Specialist,</em></li> <li><em>Northern Virginia Community College</em>&#39;s Extended Learning Institute (ELI)</li> </ul> <p><img alt=""Patricia James"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/James-Pat.jpg"" style=""height:132px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Patricia James, Moderator</strong></li> <li><em>WCET Fellow</em></li> <li>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><a href=""http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Blackboard Collaborate logo "" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/BBcollaborate.jpg"" style=""height:50px; width:181px"" /></a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx"" target=""_blank""><strong><strong>With generous support </strong></strong><strong>from Blackboard Collaborate</strong></a></p>",2014-02-13,,,,webcast,,23

Some procedures may have a technology component, other strategies may relate to course design and methods of assessment, and other actions may begin long before the fraudulent student ever logs into his/her online course.

What are some of the most important considerations? Join WCET for a webcast conversation on March 13 to learn more about CBE. Presenters include Mary Alice McCarthy, senior policy analyst with the New America Foundation, and Linda Howdyshell, college provost and senior vice president for academics and student success at Broward College for a Big Audacious Conversation about Competency-Based Education.</p> <p>In 2012, Broward College redesigned one of its programs to a competency-based model to improve student success and completion in the program. So far, the new program is promising, but there were many hurdles to overcome. The new America Foundation is a key player in a new national competency-based network funded by the Lumina Foundation. One of the goals of the new America Foundation is to create more Pathways to good jobs and good credentials. The foundation supports the creation of more types of credentials that have a labor market value. Both presenters will share valuable lessons learned and advice to institutions considering program redesign to a competency-based model.</p> <p>There will be plenty of time for audience questions.</p> <p>This webcast is provided free and open to all, but space is limited.* Registration is closed for the WCET webcast, &quot;Big Audacious Conversation About Competency-Based Education.&quot; The webcast will run for 60 minutes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/jhStdLoLYdM?rel=0"" width=""420""></iframe></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Presenters</h2> <p><img alt=""Mary Alice McCarthy"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/McCarthy-MaryAlice.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Mary Alice McCarthy</strong></li> <li><em>Senior Policy Analyst,</em></li> <li><em>Higher Education Initiative,</em></li> <li><em>New America Foundation</em></li> </ul> <p><img alt=""Linda Howdyshell"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Howdyshell-Linda.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Linda Howdyshell</strong></li> <li><em>Provost and Senior Vice President for Academics and Student Success,</em></li> <li><em>Broward College</em></li> </ul> <p><img alt=""Vernon Smith"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Smith-Vernon.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Vernon Smith, Moderator</strong></li> <li><em>Special Consultant to the Provost for Online Programs,</em></li> <li><em>Mount St. Mary&#39;s</em> College</li> </ul> <p><a href=""http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Blackboard Collaborate logo "" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/BBcollaborate.jpg"" style=""height:50px"" /></a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Collaborate/Overview.aspx"" target=""_blank""><strong><strong>With generous support </strong></strong><strong>from Blackboard Collaborate</strong></a></p>",2014-03-13,,,,webcast,,23

However, institutions must develop social media strategies and policies that consider when social media can put an institution at risk, such as when a professor sets up a class in Facebook (think ADA compliance).<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/miss604/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Graphic collage of social media icons."" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/stockphotos/social-media-icons/jpg"" style=""float:right; height:150px; width:150px"" /></a></p> <p>Join Sheri Prupis, the director of educational technology initiatives at NJEDge.net, and Cindy Hollingsworth, the social media manager at Kansas State University, for a conversation about the importance of developing an institutional social media policy.

Throughout her 11-year tenure at Capella, she gained strong expertise in all facets of state authorization, consulted and reported on professional licensure and how it intersects with state authorization, and participated in regional and programmatic accreditation activities. Sharyl laid the foundation of state authorization compliance at Capella and in her later years became the external facing representative for state authorization activities. It was during this time that the awareness of state authorization spread across the country with the U.S. Department of Education Program Integrity Rules. Because of her experience in the field, Sharyl was invited to present at numerous conferences and took on leadership roles in national initiatives for state authorization. Sharyl has also authored several articles on state authorization through WCET and has led numerous presentations and webinars.</p> <p>In early 2012, Sharyl was recruited by American College of Education to be Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Compliance. While there, she led the institution in obtaining nine state authorizations within a year and did extensive research and analysis on professional licensure of teachers and K-12 administrators. Sharyl was invited to be a member of the original Drafting Team for SARA (State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement), and was the sole institutional representative. The hard work done by this team created the framework for the agreement currently being adopted by states, which allows for reciprocity of state authorization between member states.</p> <p>In early 2014, Sharyl formed Higher Education Regulatory (HER) Consulting to assist institutions with navigating the work of state authorization compliance. She serves clients from all sectors with short-term projects to longer-term relationships as a state authorization resource.</p> <p><img alt=""Jeannie Yockey-Fine"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/YockeyFine-Jeannie.jpg"" style=""height:132px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Jeannie Yockey-Fine</strong></li> <li><em>Senior Manager</em>,</li> <li><em>State Regulatory Services</em>,</li> <li><em>Cooley LLP</em></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Jeannie Yockey-Fine works with attorneys and other professionals in the firm&#39;s Higher Education Practice to provide client institutions and organizations with expert assistance and guidance related to state authorization and regulation of higher education institutions, state institutional license application review, as well as state-level professional licensure.

The expert presenters in this program will cover a wealth of valuable information to help colleges and universities conduct an internal assessment of who is in charge, how to develop a remediation plan, what captioning features are needed (e.g. closed captioning, real-time, transcripting), and what can be learned from Kent State&rsquo;s and Texas Tech&rsquo;s work for providing captioning services to students, faculty, and staff.</p> <p>This is the first of WCET&rsquo;s three-part webcast series on educational technologies. In October, the series will cover identity authentication/secure proctoring and learning relationship management technologies. The webcast is also part of WCET&#39;s September Accessibility Month where webcasts, blogs, and discussions will focus on this important topic.</p> <p><strong>Resources:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/webcasts/2015/Captioning-Slides.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>PowerPoint Slides</strong></a></li> <li><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNyfHvFktUc"" target=""_blank""><strong>Recorded Webcast</strong></a></li> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/webcasts/2015/Captioning-Chat-Log.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Chat Log</strong></a></li> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/webcasts/2015/Captioning-Webcast-Transcript.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Caption Transcript</strong></a></li> </ul> <p>This webcast is provided free and open to all, but space is limited*</p> <p><strong>&quot;Video Captioning: Features, Costs, Good Practices, and How Captioning Benefits All Students&quot;</strong> will take place on September 10 at 11:00 AM MDT.

161,Identity Authentication and Proctoring Systems,/events/webcasts/authentication-and-proctoring-systems,"<h2>Promoting Integrity While Protecting Privacy</h2> <p>The postsecondary education sector is a major market for commercial providers of identity authentication and remote proctoring systems. While the federal requirements related to the accreditation of institutions that offer online programs remain unchanged, institutions are proactively addressing the complex issues of student identity authentication and secure proctoring towards the dual goals of protecting institutional program integrity and protecting student privacy rights.&nbsp; In addition, providers of identity and proctoring systems continue to upgrade the technologies and the processes of their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This webcast features the CEO&rsquo;s of three major providers of authentication and proctoring systems who will talk about student and faculty experiences in using their products and also will address important issues about protecting student privacy, how institutions are using these products as part of larger institutional commitment to integrity, and what the future of identity authentication may look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Karen Solomon of the Higher Learning Commission will review current requirements versus the kinds of proactive policy and process actions institutions are taking to promote the integrity of their programs. &nbsp;</p> <p>This is the second of WCET&rsquo;s three-part webcast series on educational technologies. &nbsp;</p> <p>This webcast is provided free and open to all, but space is limited*</p> <p>&quot;<strong>Identity Authentication and Proctoring Systems:&nbsp; Promoting Integrity While Protecting Privacy</strong>&quot; will take place on October 1 at 11:00 AM MDT.
