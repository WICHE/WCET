20,Leadership,/about/who-we-are/leadership,"<p>At WCET, leadership reflects the cooperative model and collaborative spirit of our organization. Many activities and programs are spearheaded by members. Committees and working groups lead the way, with guidance and support from our Steering Committee and staff. By putting decisions in the hands of our membership, we stay in close sync with members&#39; interests, even as they evolve. This also keeps our administration lean, so we can devote more of our resources to getting results.</p> <table cellpadding=""0"" summary=""governance""> <tbody> </tbody> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan=""2""><img alt=""Mike Abbiatti"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Abbiatti-Mike.jpg"" style=""height:148px; width:120px"" /></td> <td> <h3><a href=""/about/staff/bios#Mike"">Executive Director</a></h3> <p>Meet Mike Abbiatti, WCET&#39;s Executive Director.</p> </td> <td colspan=""2"">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><img alt=""Photo of Peter Smith"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Smith-Peter.jpg"" style=""height:156px; width:120px"" /></td> <td colspan=""4""> <h3><a href=""/about/who-we-are/leadership/executive-council"">Executive Council</a></h3> <p>The Executive Council serves as the strategic advisory group to the Executive Director on matters related to membership, annual dues, strategic priorities, policies and other issues.</p> <p>Chair, Peter Smith.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><img alt=""Photo of Luke Dowden"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Dowden-Luke.jpg"" style=""height:156px; width:120px"" /></td> <td colspan=""4""> <h3><a href=""/about/who-we-are/leadership/steering-committee"">Steering Committee</a></h3> <p>The Steering Committee is representative of the WCET membership, makes recommendations on programmatic issues of interest to the membership, and leads and/or contributes to activities in support of WCET&#39;s programs and membership.</p> <p>Chair, Luke Dowden.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> <tbody> </tbody> </table> <p>Volunteer to Serve</p> <p>In addition to the above opportunities, WCET also has several ad hoc and special purpose committees, such as the Annual Meeting Planning Committee and the Awards Committee.

52,e-Learning Consortia Profiles,/initiatives/consortia/profiles,"<p>An e-Learning Consortium fosters inter-institutional partnerships to share resources with the goal of increasing the institutional capacity for technology-mediated courses and programs. So that leaders and stakeholders of consortia could learn from the successes and experiences of others, the e-Learning Consortia Common Interest Group collected profiles and contact information for many consortia. For each consortium that responded, the profile includes their mission, a brief description, services that they offer, initiatives and interests, organizational documents, and contact information, including websites and social media.</p> <p>If your consortium is not listed or would like to submit a profile, <a href=""mailto:wcetinfo@wiche.edu?subject=Request%20to%20Add%20e-Learning%20Consortia%20Profile"">contact us</a>.

KCTCS Online classes require communication with faculty and other students via email or discussion groups, taking online tests or proctored tests, and submitting various assignments via attachments.</p> <p>KCTCS Online offers two convenient online options: Learn by Term and Learn on Demand. Both of these online opportunities offer numerous program and course options.

Most importantly, the collaborative spirit of the eleven institutions and their willingness to share whatever they are doing is central to the success of the distance education effort in the NDUS.</p> <h3>Description</h3> <p>When created in 2001, the North Dakota University System Online was an entity unto itself, but operating within the confines of the North Dakota University System. With new leadership in 2007, websites outside of the official NDUS were closed and merged into the system site.</p> <p>With that administrative decision, the focus of the NDUSO moved from a system focus within the NDUS to a collaborative relationship assisting distance education initiatives on the eleven campuses. Essentially, the NDUSO was assimilated into the NDUS and identified as a service function of the system office. Distance education was not perceived as mission critical, but rather as an auxiliary activity of the individual institutions and its residential delivery.</p> <h3>Services</h3> <p>With the realignment, the NDUSO provided a focus for the eleven institutions ranging from copyright issues, online faculty and course development, and working with the adult learner. The NDUSO provided opportunities at the system level that were often beyond the resources of the individual institutions. The sharing of resources and learning opportunities for the eleven distance education directors was a valuable resource and service of the NDUSO.</p> <h3>Initiatives &amp; Interests</h3> <p>The NDUSO has been able to position itself as a collaborative agent working with the eleven institutions. Rather than a directive, &#39;top down&#39; agency, the NDUSO works with the institutional partners to provide whatever assistance helps them move their initiatives forward in serving the students of North Dakota and elsewhere.</p> <p>Last Updated: July 2013</p>",96,

81,State Authorization Network (SAN),/initiatives/state-authorization-network,"<p>Join the State Authorization Network</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>With the growth of distance education, institutions are enrolling students in an increasing number of states. Before enrolling those students, those states expect the institution to have followed their laws and to have <a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization"" target=""_blank"">received any necessary authorization</a> to operate in their jurisdiction. The U.S. Department of Education&#39;s state authorization regulations were vacated by the courts, but seem to be en route to being reinstated.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>Expecting each institution to navigate authorization regulations in every state is highly inefficient. Working cooperatively, institutions can share the burden.</p> <p>The process of obtaining compliance in each state is difficult because:</p> <ul> <li>The rules and regulations regarding authorization vary greatly from state to state.</li> <li>Deciphering the approval/licensure regulations takes significant analysis. Many institutions do not have the staff available to perform all the necessary analyses.</li> <li>States change their regulations, interpretations, and procedures over time.</li> </ul> <h2>The Solution</h2> <p>Working collaboratively, institutions can navigate the state regulations processes more efficiently than working on their own. WCET&#39;s State Authorization Network (SAN) assists the &#39;Coordinators&#39; from each member system, consortium, or institution. Through access to experts and networking among others seeking to comply, WCET provides:</p> <p><strong>Upcoming Events</strong>:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""/events/SAN-workshop/july-2015"">State Authorization Compliance Workshop</a> - July 23-24, 2015 Denver, CO</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Monthly Calls.</li> <li>Email Lists.</li> <li>Face-to-face Meetings.</li> <li>Discussions with Regulators.</li> <li>Research Reports.</li> <li>State Advocacy.</li> <li>Reciprocity Advice.</li> <li>Training Webcasts.</li> </ul> <h2>Cost</h2> <p>$5,000 for a system, consortium, or individual institution to join.

82,State Authorization Network - FAQ,/initiatives/state-authorization-network/FAQ,"<p><em>Expecting each institution to navigate authorization regulations in every state is highly inefficient. Working cooperatively, institution can share the burden.</em></p> <h2>State Authorization Network</h2> <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3> <h3>March 3, 2011</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>How will this benefit my institutions?</p> <p>The Coordinators will receive extensive background on the &ldquo;state authorization&rdquo; regulations, the latest on state regulations, and efforts to rescind or delay this regulation. A major benefit will be the on-going networking among Coordinators. As they learn about problems in dealing with a state regulatory agency or changes in the state regulations they will quickly share this information with each other. Having Coordinators who are well-versed in the regulations and the latest developments will assist each of your institutions in meeting the State requirements. It will also save the institutions from each having to research and decipher the state regulations on their own.</p> <p>Is there really any benefit to networking?</p> <p>Our experience in other projects indicates that networking will be the greatest benefit. People faced with the same task are provided an opportunity to share and learn from each other. They are speaking the same language and facing the same obstacles. Networking aids in the exchange of ideas and collaborative problem-solving.</p> <p>When and where will the initial face-to-face meeting be held?</p> <p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> April 6-7, 2011. The meeting will start on the morning of April 6 and will end no later than 1:00 pm on April 7.</p> <p><em><strong>Location:</strong></em> Boulder, CO</p> <p>Included will be two lunches, a dinner, and refreshments. Travel and lodging are not included. The Residence Inn is offering our group lodging for $133/night. Registration for two participants is included in the fee. Additional details and registration information will be sent to systems or consortia that commit to joining the network by March 18.</p> <p>What will be on the agenda of the face-to-face meeting?</p> <p>The tentative agenda includes:</p> <ul> <li>History and current interpretation of the regulations.</li> <li>Reciprocity agreements - current agreements and how this can help in the future.</li> <li>Advocacy update - what is the latest status of efforts to rescind or delay implementation of the regulation?</li> <li>State information - what are the latest developments regarding lists of state agencies and analysis of which institutions need to apply to each state.</li> <li>State regulators - How can we best work with them to make both the regulator&#39;s and coordinator&#39;s jobs easier? Are there some &#39;exceptions&#39; that some states would consider (i.e., not worrying about institutions teaching fewer than 10 students in a state as long as the institution notified the regulator)?</li> <li>Updates from participants - what is each participating system/consortium doing?</li> <li>What&#39;s next? How do we communicate? What tools do we use? How can we help each other - the importance of sharing and networking.</li> </ul> <p>Speakers include: Russ Poulin - WCET, Megan Raymond - WCET, Mike Goldstein - Dow Lohnes, Bruce Chaloux - Southern Regional Education Board, Paul Shiffman - Excelsior College, and Marianne Boeke - National Center for Higher Education Management Systems.</p> <p>Will the session be streamed?</p> <p>There will be no streaming of any of the sessions. These types of sessions work best if you focus on one medium, either face-to-face or all streamed. Trying to do both will make one or both sets of participants unhappy. We are researching options for recording the sessions and making those available for later use.</p> <p>What will be covered in the webcasts?</p> <p>Each webcast will include updates and we will rely on the needs of the Coordinators to help us guide the content and timing of webcasts. Some candidate options for webcast topics include:</p> <ul> <li>&#39;Dear Colleague&#39; letter. Once the US ED&#39;s Dear Colleague letter is released, we will have a webcast within two weeks to help you deal with the new information.</li> <li>Session with a US ED representative. US ED personnel are currently barred from talking about this issue. Once that restriction is removed, we will have a representative or two address us and answer questions.</li> <li>How do the for-profits handle this issue? They have more experience in dealing with State agencies. What lessons have they learned?</li> <li>What are other coordinators doing? Highlight the activities of a few coordinators who have been successful.</li> <li>What if there is a delay in the implementation? What does that mean? What should we be doing? Waiting for the next deadline does not seem like a good idea.</li> <li>Advocacy/lobbying updates. What is the latest in terms of efforts and progress in delaying or rescinding the regulation?</li> </ul> <p>What happens to the Network if we are successful in delaying or rescinding the regulation?</p> <p>There are so many variables in play that we cannot give you a definite answer at t his time. Please be assured that if a delay or rescission occurs, we will negotiate with the participating systems/consortia to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. In the case of a delay, it will still be in the best interest of the Network to continue to meet and work towards being in compliance.</p> <p>Does this mean that WCET members will no longer receive information about the &#39;State Authorization&#39; issue?</p> <p>No. It does not. WCET members will continue to receive the same timely updates and advice that they have always received.

84,Edutools,/initiatives/past-projects/edutools,"<p>For more than a decade, WCET's EduTools website was a leading destination for educational technology decision makers. The independent reviews and side-by-side comparisons of educational technology products were used by colleges and universities of all sizes, higher education systems and other multi-campus service providers to expedite and streamline their internal processes for the review and evaluation of products, saving them time and duplicative effort. EduTools was best known for its CMS/LMS comparative reviews and a detailed matrix of CMS/LMS features and criteria.</p> <p><strong>EduTools Matrix</strong><br /> Many visitors to EduTools used the detailed matrix of LMS/CMS features, descriptions, and criteria as a tool in developing requests for proposals and evaluation requirements. This resource covers communications tools, productivity tools, student involvement tools, administration tools, course delivery tools, content development tools, hardware/software definitions, and cost/licensing definitions. <a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/resources/OldEdutoolsCMSFeaturesandCriteriaRev041513.docx"" target=""_blank"">This matrix</a> was last updated in 2006.</p> <p>EduTools was launched in 2001 with funding support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

85,Transparency by Design,/initiatives/past-projects/transparency-by-design,"<p>The Transparency by Design initiative was a collaborative collection of regionally-accredited, adult-serving, distance education institutions with a mission to help adult learners become informed consumers of distance education. A project of the <a href=""http://presidentsforum.excelsior.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Presidents&#39; Forum of Excelsior College</a>, in 2008, <a href=""/home"" target=""_blank"">WCET </a>was engaged to serve as project management and third-party data quality assurance reviewer for the forthcoming product website of the initiative. In 2009, Transparency by Design launched College Choices for Adults, an innovative resource to help adult learners utilize data, not marketing fluff, to match their professional and personal goals with an appropriate distance learning program.</p> <p><strong>Resources developed by the Transparency by Design initiative:</strong></p> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/tbd/TbD-Executive-Brief.pdf"" target=""_blank"">TbD Executive Brief.</a></p> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/tbd/TbD-Data-Methodologies.pdf"" target=""_blank"">TbD Data Methodologies.</a></p> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/tbd/Learner-Progress-Methodology.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Learner Progress Metrics.</a></p> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/tbd/THEGUIDE.pdf"" target=""_blank"">The Guide: An Adult Learner Resource.</a></p> <p><a href=""/initiatives/past-projects/transparency-by-design/history"">TbD History.</a></p> <p>College Choices for Adults, and the Transparency by Design initiative had three key differentiators from other college search sites or voluntary systems of accountability:</p> <ol> <li>The website provided <em><strong>program-level learning outcomes</strong></em> (aka what students are expected to learn in each program of study), measures of those learning outcomes, and how well recent students have performed. This type of data is rarely shared publicly, but TbD partner institutions <em>chose</em> (completely voluntarily!) to share publicly on the web. This allowed adult learners to align their personal and professional goals with educational opportunities which have matching program-level learning outcomes.</li> <li>All of the data on the College Choices for Adults site went through a <em><strong>third-party quality assurance review</strong></em> by the WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies (WCET). Other sites post data without any review by an outside party. Transparency by Design institutions <em>voluntarily</em> submitted to this review to ensure quality data to help adults make their college choice.</li> <li>Institutions involved in Transparency by Design provide distance learning** options for adult learners*, thus the <em><strong>primary focus on adult learners</strong></em>. Other sites often focus on the priorities of traditional-aged students, such as campus life. College Choices for Adults concentrated on informing adults on how they can progress toward personal goals.</li> </ol> <p><em>* enroll students 23 years and older.</em><br /> <em>**distance learning encompasses online, hybrid, competency-based and other flexible learning formats.</em></p> <p>At the beginning of 2013, the College Choices for Adults website was shut down, after a unanimous decision of the Transparency by Design Executive Committee. Though a worthwhile project, the College Choices for Adults website was ahead of its time in accountability measures and thus was unable to reach self-sustaining membership levels.</p> <h2>A Video Review of the College Choices for Adults Website</h2> <p>For a look at the functionality of the College Choices for Adults website, we have created the following videos:</p> <p><br /> CCFA Project Overview</p> <p><br /> CCFA The Guide</p> <p><br /> CCFA Institution &amp;<br /> Program Data</p> <h2>Contact:</h2> <p><img alt=""Cali Morrison"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Morrison-Cali.pdf"" style=""height:129px; width:100px"" /></p> <ul> <li><a href=""mailto:cmorrison@wiche.edu""><strong>Cali Morrison</strong></a></li> <li>Manager, Communications, WCET</li> <li>Project Director, Transparency by Design<br /> Phone: 303-541-0234</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>",240,

89,WOW Media Release 2014,/initiatives/wcet-awards/wow/media-release-2014,"<p><strong>WCET Recognizes Institutions Answering Challenges with Innovative Programs</strong></p> <p>Boulder, CO - Since 2004, the WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies (WCET) has been presenting the WCET Outstanding Work (WOW) award to colleges, universities and organizations who are implementing exceptionally creative, technology-based solutions to contemporary challenges in higher education. The WOW award helps WCET meet its mission of promoting innovative and effective practice by providing exemplary programs as models for the higher education community to adapt for their own students and faculty.</p> <p>This year&#39;s WOW award recipients have all implemented solutions in areas shown to have impact on student success ranging from flexible learning options to an online writing lab and an OER-based associate degree.</p> <ul> <li>Capella University: <strong>FlexPath</strong> is a competency-based, direct-assessment delivery option for several bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees and post-baccalaureate certificates.</li> <li>Colorado Technical University: <strong>intellipath&trade; for MBA preparation</strong> is an adaptive learning implementation that is both assessment and facilitator driven, targeted at ensuring all MBA students have the base knowledge they need to be successful in the classroom and their careers.</li> <li>Excelsior College: <strong>Online Writing Lab (OWL)</strong> addresses the need for stronger writing support for college students through use of an open-source environment with extensive multimedia elements.</li> <li>Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) Extended Learning Institute: <strong>NOVA&#39;s OER-Based Associate Degree Project</strong> is a comprehensive approach to addressing access, affordability, and student success through use of open educational resources.</li> <li>University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee: <strong>U-Pace</strong> instructional approach integrates self-paced, mastery-based learning with instructor-initiated Amplified Assistance in an online environment.</li> </ul> <p>&quot;Each year this coveted award is bestowed upon institutions who are creatively applying technological innovations to answer the big questions related to student access and success in higher education,&quot; said Shanna Coles, interim director, distance education &amp; summer school, UNC Charlotte and chair, WOW Award committee. &quot;Encompassed in this year&#39;s winners, we have effective models to help students move towards credentials quickly, with the foundation necessary for success while keeping access and affordability at the forefront.&quot;</p> <p>The WOW awardees will be recognized by WCET&#39;s national community of higher education innovators during the <a href=""http://wcetconference.wiche.edu/"" target=""_blank"">WCET 26th Annual Meeting</a> in Portland, OR, November 19-21, 2014.</p> <h2>Capella University: FlexPath</h2> <p><a href=""http://www.capella.edu/flexpath-self-paced-learning/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Capella University logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Capella.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:88px; width:175px"" /></a>The U.S. Department of Education approved Capella University&#39;s innovation <a href=""http://www.capella.edu/flexpath-self-paced-learning"" target=""_blank"">FlexPath</a> direct-assessment programs in August 2013. This made Capella the first university to offer competency-based bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree programs that utilize an approved direct-assessment learning model. Capella&#39;s FlexPath programs offer the potential to significantly reduce the cost of a degree, accelerate the time required for degree completion, and better align learning to the needs of the student, employers and society. Traditionally, degree programs are constructed around credit hours that measure the time required to complete specific courses. Under the FlexPath model, degree programs are constructed around the direct assessment of demonstrated competencies.</p> <p>The FlexPath model provides a revolutionary step into more innovative approaches to higher education. It allows Capella to focus on learning outcomes rather than time spent learning. In an era of free and open content, this is an important innovation that will help drive down costs for students while still making Capella University instruction available for those who will benefit from a more traditional approach. Faculty remain at the heart of this model as they design the curriculum and assessments, as well as provide instruction through feedback and guidance for students working to demonstrate and master competencies. The true success of this innovative model depends on rigorously articulated and well-developed competencies. Capella has an extensive record of developing and offering curricula that are competency-based.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact: <a href=""mailto:mike.buttry@capella.edu"">Mike Buttry</a><br /> Title: VP of Public Affairs and Communications<br /> Phone: 612-977-5499</p> <h2>Colorado Technical University: intellipath&trade; for MBA preparation</h2> <p><a href=""http://www.coloradotech.edu/online-degree-programs/intellipath"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Colorado Technical University logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Colorado-Technical-University.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:27px; width:175px"" /></a>Colorado Technical University (CTU) recognized that its MBA program was in need of a platform that would address students entering the program at varying levels of knowledge.

CTU saw the potential to leverage a new adaptive learning platform to help address both of these educational needs.</p> <p>In 2013, the University implemented a program called <a href=""http://www.coloradotech.edu/online-degree-programs/intellipath"" target=""_blank"">intellipath</a>.

CTU selected this technology because it uses student interactions and data to provide a personalized learning experience. While adaptive learning technology isn&#39;t new, when used in the educational setting, this technology creates a personalized learning plan that gives students extra support where they need it, while quickly moving over areas of competency. As a result, there is sustained learning rather than short-term memorization. This long-term knowledge retention builds a foundation for success both in the classroom and beyond.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact: <a href=""mailto:cjohnson@coloradotech.edu"">Constance Johnson</a><br /> Title: Provost and Chief Academic Officer<br /> Phone: 224-293-5958</p> <h2>Excelsior College: Online Writing Lab</h2> <p><a href=""http://owl.excelsior.edu/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Excelsior College logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Excelsior-College.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:55px; width:175px"" /></a>According to national research, writing remains a significant challenge for many college students and better support is needed.

The OWL provides warm and engaging support for students who need introductory writing help or a refresher for more advanced courses. Available 24/7 and accessible via desktop or mobile device, the OWL creates an engaging learning environment via writing exercises, video tutorials, quizzes and an interactive video game. With seven learning areas, the OWL provides comprehensive coverage, making it a flexible resource for both writing courses and courses across the disciplines. Over 40 colleges and universities in the U.S. are using this free resource in their classes and writing centers.</p> <p>An independent study found students who used the OWL improved their writing skills and processes and increased their final grades by an average of 6.6 points. Students in treatment groups who used the OWL also showed greater improvement in their approaches to writing tasks and reported more positive attitudes toward writing. They also showed greater improvement in key writing skill areas, including context and purpose for writing, use of sources and evidence, and control of syntax and mechanics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact: <a href=""mailto:crystal_sands@excelsior.edu"">Crystal Sands</a>, PhD<br /> Title: Director, Online Writing Lab<br /> Phone: 518-608-8248</p> <h2>Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) Extended Learning Institute: OER-Based Associate Degree Project</h2> <p><a href=""http://eli.nvcc.edu/oer/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Northern Virginia Community College logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Northern-Virginia-Comm-College.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:35px; width:175px"" /></a>The need to increase access to and reduce the costs of attending college is a burden shared by all higher education institutions.

Students take a quiz as they complete each section of the material and must achieve at least a 90 percent before moving on to the next section. The learning management system includes numerous variations of each quiz so students can retake any quiz as many times as needed. They receive an immediate score, but aren&#39;t told what questions they got wrong since the goal is to master the concept rather than just memorize answers to questions.</p> <p>This mastery-based learning is supported by Amplified Assistance, which allows instructors to shape students&#39; success, and give them customized feedback about specific learning challenges they may be having. Instructors deliver the feedback via email, using templates provided in the U-Pace manual that they can edit and personalize to help them respond to student needs. The value of this approach is that it allows instructors to identify students who are struggling, and reach out to them proactively. As a result, even those students who are reluctant to approach an instructor for help receive positive support and encouragement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact: <a href=""mailto:reddy@uwm.edu"">Dianne M.

The WCET Outstanding Work (WOW) Award recognizes: outstanding innovation, quality improvement, or other achievements in using educational technology tools or techniques to educate (or support educating) students.</p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2>MEDIA RELEASE</h2> <h3>WCET Announces Awards for Outstanding Use of Technology in Higher Education</h3> <p>Boulder, Colorado &mdash; WCET is pleased to announce the names of the five recipients of the 2007 WCET Outstanding Work (WOW) Award: Kansas State University, Rio Salado College, Connecticut Distance Learning Consortium, Minnesota Online, and the American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service. The annual award recognizes innovative and effective uses of technologies in educating and serving students.</p> <p>&ldquo;The WOW Award represents a way to recognize and celebrate the best and most promising practices within the WCET community,&rdquo; says <strong>Paul Wasko, WCET Awards Committee chair</strong> and assistant director for e-learning services and related efforts in the Academic Affairs Division of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. &ldquo;For the 2007 WOW Award, there was a wonderful slate of possible recipients that made the committee&rsquo;s job especially difficult. This year&rsquo;s recipients reinforced the value of innovative solutions and the need to always keep in mind the needs of the student as consumer.&rdquo; The 2007 WOW recipients include:</p> <p><strong>Kansas StateUniversity: ExpanSIS</strong> - A Multi-Institutional Student Information System. The university&rsquo;s Institute for Academic Alliances and Office of Mediated Education created ExpanSIS, a secure, web-based system for exchanging time-sensitive information about courses and students among partner institutions. Developed for consortia where students enroll at their home institution for courses taught by faculty at partner institutions, ExpanSIS contains consortium course information for partner institutions to create course sections for enrollment on their own campuses. After students enroll at home, the information is entered into ExpanSIS, so the teaching institution can access course rosters; set up course access for students; and track student drops and refunds. The teaching institution records grades directly into ExpanSIS for enrolling institutions to transfer back into their own systems.</p> <p><strong>Rio Salado College</strong>: Online Teacher Education Programs &ldquo;Virtual Practicum&rdquo; Experience. Rio Salado College&rsquo;s online teacher preparation Virtual Practicums are professional videotapes of live classroom experiences that demonstrate classroom techniques that are critical for students to learn but that may not be available during practicums or student-teaching experiences. The Virtual Practicums are created by master teachers and provide a value-added element to content areas that students find difficult, such as phonics, classroom management, and structured English immersion. Special education practicums are also available.</p> <p><strong>Connecticut Distance Learning Consortium</strong>: A Multi-state Collaborative eTutoring Program. The Connecticut Distance Learning Consortium has developed a collaborative online tutoring program that brings together the resources of two- and four-year public and private institutions of higher education. Serving students at 33 colleges and universities in seven states, eTutoring.org utilizes tutors provided by the institutions and trained in the use of its technology and online tutoring protocols. All student and tutor interaction is hosted on eTutoring&rsquo;s own synchronous and asynchronous platform, facilitating access to a single program that&rsquo;s available to the students at all participating institutions.</p> <p><strong>Minnesota Online:Support Center.</strong> The Minnesota Online Support Center was created by several agencies interested in fostering a system in which services were student- and customer-centered. Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, Minnesota Online, Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs, eFolio Minnesota, Online College in the High School, and Distance Minnesota together created a support center whose team is able to respond quickly, engaging with individuals associated with the partner programs. This team provides individualized, accurate, and compassionate support to veterans and active military personnel from across Minnesota, as well as offering 24/7 educational support to individuals worldwide. Users may search the online FAQs, ask questions online, engage in online chat with a team member, or call through toll-free or international phone numbers. Minnesota State Community and Technical College, one of the regional consortium colleges, is the host of the center.</p> <p><strong>American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service</strong>: The Online College for Funeral Service Education. American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service (AAMI), one of the oldest accredited funeral service schools, based in New York City, discovered a large, unmet national need for access to funeral service schools: 19 states didn&rsquo;t have a funeral service school and 70 percent of the existing schools were community colleges that only served their own region. AAMI&rsquo;s solution was to launch a comprehensive, fully online degree program in funeral service. With the assistance of consultants and a contract with the Connecticut Distance Learning Consortium, AAMI offered its first six online courses in January 2006. By April 2007 all courses (except the clinical capstone experience, which will be held in New York City) were offered online each semester, and AAMI enrollments had doubled.</p> <h3>About WCET &amp; WICHE</h3> <p><a href=""/home"">WCET</a> is a cooperative that&rsquo;s actively engaged in sharing cutting-edge research and best practices in the effective use of technology in higher education.

Since 2004 the WCET WOW award has been presented to higher education institutions and organizations for exceptionally creative, technology-based solutions to a significant problem or need. In 2010, the awards go to four ambitious projects, each addressing a challenging issue with a unique solution: changing the role of journalism and new media to promote civic engagement; providing adult learners with on-demand programs and services to encourage degree completion; increasing the adoption of open textbooks to lower student costs; and promoting the integrity of academic online programs.</p> <p>2010&#39;s WOW Award recipients:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""http://collegeopentextbooks.org"" target=""_blank"">Foothill-De Anza Community College District</a></li> <li><a href=""http://online.kctcs.edu"" target=""_blank"">Kentucky Virtual Campus</a></li> <li><a href=""www.riosalado.edu/Pages/Default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Rio Salado College</a></li> <li><a href=""http://www.winona360.org"">Winona State University</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;This year the selection process included a more explicit review of measurable outcomes to assess the actual impact of each approach to the specific, targeted need,&rdquo; noted Peg O&rsquo;Brien, WOW Awards Committee chair and director of extended programs for Dakota State University in South Dakota. &ldquo;The WCET WOW award represents a great tribute to the work of the winning organizations, and also serves as a meaningful way to disseminate exemplar practices to the higher education community.&rdquo;</p> <p>These winning projects, which will be honored at the <a href=""http://wcetconference.wiche.edu/"" target=""_blank"">WCET Annual Conference</a> on November 10-13 in La Jolla, California, include the following:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><a href=""http://collegeopentextbooks.org"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Foothill-De Anza Community College District logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/Logos/FHDA-Community-College-District.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:150px; width:150px"" /></a>Foothill-De Anza Community College District&rsquo;s <a href=""http://collegeopentextbooks.org"">College Open Textbooks Collaborative</a></strong> addresses the goal of textbook costs for community college students, a problem than can be a barrier to college success. The College Open Textbooks Collaborative, funded by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has implemented a multifaceted strategy to increase adoption of open textbooks among community college faculty. Within a robust, Web-based participatory-learning community of pioneering faculty and students, the collaborative provides training for instructors adopting open resources; accessibility assurances and peer reviews of open textbooks; mentoring of authors opening their textbooks; research on factors that affect open textbook adoption; and advocacy support for other campus stakeholders in the adoption process. The collaborative makes extensive use of free and low cost Web 2.0 tools to facilitate shared use of all training materials, peer reviews, and other collateral created by its members.</p> <p>To focus its efforts on areas of greatest impact, the collaborative identified the top 40 community college courses with the highest enrollments nationwide. To date, more than 500 open textbooks have been identified and catalogued online in such disciplines as math, physics, chemistry, business, economics, and sociology. Nearly 100 of these open textbooks have undergone extensive peer review, and many have been reviewed for accessibility standards. Collaborative members include over 200 community colleges in the U.S. and Canada, several open educational resources (OER) repositories, educational researchers, and the OER Center for California, among others. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L79UB0lM56Q"" target=""_blank"">Watch the video!</a></p> <p>Contact:<br /> <a href=""mailto:sharyn.fitzpatrick@happyabout.info"">Sharyn Fitzpatrick</a>, College Open Textbooks Marketing<br /> 650-564-0011<br /> <a href=""mailto:dalyuna@fhda.edu"">Una Daly</a>, Associate Director, College Open Textbooks<br /> Foothill-De Anza Community College District<br /> 650-949-7118<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong><a href=""http://online.kctcs.edu""><img alt=""KCTCS Online logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/KCTCS-Online.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:134px; width:150px"" /></a><a href=""http://www.kyvc.org/"" target=""_blank"">Kentucky Virtual Campus</a>&rsquo;s <a href=""http://online.kctcs.edu"" target=""_blank"">KCTCS Online</a> &ndash; Learn on Demand</strong>, a partnership of Kentucky Virtual Campus (KYVC) and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), is designed to provide working adult students with flexible access to &ldquo;learn on demand&rdquo; online courses and programs. Kentucky, like many states, has a statewide goal of increasing the number of bachelor&rsquo;s degree holders and expanding upon program offerings that prepare students for the 21st century workforce requirements. Learn on Demand, formerly known as the Virtual Learning Initiative, features fully online courses that are modularized, self-paced, open-entry, and competency-based, with all content integrated into the learning management system, eliminating student expenditures for textbooks. Adult students can earn credit for prior knowledge, access a 24/7 online student services help desk, and sign learning contracts which detail their responsibility for succeeding in the Learn on Demand model. As part of KCTCS&rsquo;s online organization, students have ready access to information concerning program requirements and course options, as well as exceptional support as they progress toward their educational goals.</p> <p>The first programs launched include an associate degree in business administration, an associate degree in information technology, and certificates that address specific workforce needs. Since its launch in April 2009, the program has experienced rapid enrollment growth, with 80 percent of its enrollees being new KCTCS students.

The system is intended to deter cheating, which will greatly benefit students by helping to ensure the long-term value and integrity of Rio&rsquo;s academic programs. As of March 2010, the system has scanned thousands of new student submissions and has detected 450 suspected cases of peer-to-peer plagiarism&mdash;cases that would almost certainly not have been detected using more traditional monitoring techniques. This is either because the two submissions were only a partial match &ndash; that is, one student changed a substantial portion of the text prior to submission &ndash; or because the two students were enrolled in different semesters or with different instructors. The system has also run consistently over time with extremely minimal downtime, which reflects its long-term stability.</p> <p>Faculty and staff response to the plagiarism detector has been extremely positive. John Jensen, current Rio Salado faculty president, praised the new system: &ldquo;The peer-to-peer plagiarism detection system is a key element in fortifying Rio Salado&rsquo;s commitment to academic integrity. What is more, it reinforces in students the formation of ethical behavior and self-reliance as critical values in their character development and their learning as a personal responsibility.

Winona360.org has been built on a conception of civic media. Civic media goes beyond the traditional journalism of news gathering and reporting and includes any form of communication (text, video, photography, virtual reality, gaming) by professionals and citizens alike that strengthens the social bonds within a community or fosters civic engagement among its residents. This concept integrates and extends information technology and multimedia in a regional learning community. Winona360.org is a community Website, made possible by collaborations between Winona State faculty and students, as well as partnerships with Saint Mary&rsquo;s University, Southeast Technical College, and local high schools, which have come together through this project to create a community classroom.</p> <p>As evidenced by the quantitative data and qualitative feedback, the truly significant outcome has been how much the community has embraced the need for a new media platform and how willing they have been to engage in it as a collaborative process between professional journalists, editors, students, faculty, and community members, all working to create a new civic media. In addition, the university, secondary schools, and community have embraced Winona360 and its model for civic media as a platform for new forms of teaching and engaged learning.

Since 2004 the WCET WOW award has been presented to higher education institutions and organizations for exceptionally creative, technology-based solutions to a significant problem or need. Twenty-three works were nominated by colleges and universities across the country this year, and three were named winners. Each of them addresses a critical goal related to student retention and completion, demonstrating an innovative solution to one specific aspect of overall student success. The issues addressed by 2011 WOW awardees include students who enter college with no plan for their educational goals nor a roadmap for how they might begin to create a plan; the need to promote awareness of and emotional resilience against suicide in college students; and keeping pace with student demands for engaging online courses that make appropriate use of social media and multimedia resources.</p> <p>2011&#39;s WOW Award recipients:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""http://www.gpslifeplan.org/century/"" target=""_blank"">Century College</a></li> <li><a href=""http://universitylifecafe.org"" target=""_blank"">Kansas State University</a></li> <li><a href=""http://www.regis.edu/regis.asp?sctn=facst&amp;p1=cpsdld"" target=""_blank"">Regis University </a></li> </ul> <p>&quot;Each of these three initiatives addresses a specific area of need that cuts across higher education institutions of all sizes and from all sectors--student ownership of their educational pathway and options, the critical need to pay more attention to the mental health stressors many college students face, and the need to provide faculty with as many tools as possible to offer engaging online courses that incorporate many of the learning tools that our students use inside and outside of the virtual classroom,&quot; says Peg O&#39;Brien, WOW award committee chair and director of extended programs for Dakota State University in South Dakota. &quot;The WCET WOW award represents a great tribute to the work of the winning organizations and also serves as a meaningful way to disseminate exemplary practices to the higher education community. I encourage other institutions use these models and adapt them for their own students and faculty.&quot;</p> <p>The winning projects will be honored at the <a href=""http://wcetconference.wiche.edu/"" target=""_blank"">WCET Annual Conference</a> on October 26-29 in Denver, and featured in a free webcast, &quot;<a href=""/events/webcasts"" target=""_blank"">Achieving Innovation in Higher Education</a>,&quot; scheduled for October 17 at 1:00 pm MDT.

The GPS (Goals + Plans = Success) LifePlan includes three key components; a one-stop website with links to resources and activities to help students develop their goals and plans related to career, education, finance, leadership, and personal development; the use of eFolio (an electronic portfolio) to track and reflect upon activities completed; and on-campus activities such as workshops and curriculum integration. The initial development of GPS LifePlan at Century College was spawned by the work of a collegewide task force, convened to address issues of poor student college readiness and the high number of students who tested into at least one developmental course.</p> <p>The use of the GPS LifePlan has been infused into the work that educational professionals are already doing in the area of student success. Over 120 faculty members have integrated the program into their curriculum. With support from the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, the program has been adopted by 18 colleges, one university, and three collaborative organizations. Through partnerships with the state&#39;s National Guard, Veterans Affairs, Economic Development, and Education agencies, additional versions were created for the following audiences: military, workforce, and secondary students. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IvyRrEAUDg"" target=""_blank"">Watch the video!</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact:<br /> <a href=""mailto:Michele.jersak@century.edu?subject=2011%20WOW%20Award%20Recipient"">Michele Jersak</a><br /> Counselor and GPS LifePlan Outreatch Coordinator<br /> Century College<br /> 651-779-3221</p> <h3>Kansas State University</h3> <p><strong><a href=""http://universitylifecafe.org"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Kansas State University logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Kansas-State-University.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:47px; width:200px"" /></a><a href=""http://universitylifecafe.org"" target=""_blank"">University Life Cafe</a></strong> serves as the first interactive college website promoting the mental wellness and academic success of college students.Originally developed with a three-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the site features a gallery of user-submitted artwork, writing, and photography; a blog for students to identify and share similar experiences; and resources from a network of mental health professionals. The site is available for public view, with content contributed entirely by K-State student, faculty, and staff. It reaches all K-State campuses and the university&#39;s distance-student community globally. These audiences total approximately 23,500 students and 4,000 faculty/staff. Google Analytics reports an international reach of site visits from 147 countries, translated into 71 languages. University Life Cafe now is sustained by the K-State Counseling Center.</p> <p>This engaging, community-based approach for university counseling services met an urgent need to educate and empower the campus and larger community to recognize signs of risk for suicide and other menatl health issues, providing a safe venue for students to express themselves and reach out to trained counseling staff. The American College Health Association reported that 9.8 percent of students have seriously considered committing suicide, and the American Psychological Association reported suicide as the second highest cause of death among college students. Since its launch in 2009, at least one K-State student used the site to express emotional distress and threat, resulting in a successful protective intervention by trained campus staff. The American College Personnel Association named University Life Cafe&#39; as one of the top innovations in college counseling for the 2009-2010 academic year. <a href=""https://www.universitylifecafe.org/gallery/university-life-cafe-website-overview/"" target=""_blank"">Watch the video!</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact:<br /> <a href=""mailto:bpearson@ksu.edu?subject=WOW%202011%20Award%20Recipient"">Barbara Pearson</a><br /> Director, University Life Cafe<br /> Assistant Director, K-State Counseling Services<br /> Kansas State University<br /> 785-532-6927</p> <h3>Regis University</h3> <p><a href=""http://www.regis.edu/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Regis University logo"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/icons/logos/Regis-University.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:73px; width:200px"" /></a><strong><a href=""http://www.regis.edu/regis.asp?sctn=facst&amp;p1=cpsdld"" target=""_blank"">Passport to Course Development</a> </strong>addresses the challenge faced by many institutions with rapidly growing enrollments in e-learning; providing adequate training and support for faculty, oftentimes adjunct faculty, who are new to the online environment.

108,Frequently Asked Questions about the Federal Regulations,/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/faq,"<p>Below are WCET's best take at answering some common questions about these regulations.</p> <h2>Regarding these regulations, how is this different from a state resident going to another state to study?</h2> <p>It all has to do with where the education is offered. Remember that much of this has to do with consumer protection and which state has jurisdiction in assuring protection of a consumer. When a state&rsquo;s resident decides to cross state lines and go to another state, that state resident has decided to leave the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of his/her home state. If the student remains in-state, then the regulations of the state in which that education is offered come into play. The state is protecting its citizen who has decided to consume a product offered within state boundaries.</p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2>These regulations may be about &quot;consumer protection,&quot; but doesn&#39;t it also have a lot to do with &quot;turf protection?&quot;</h2> <p>&ldquo;Turf protection&rdquo; may have entered into some of the existing state rules regarding regulation of out-of-state education providers. As for the federal government&rsquo;s most recent actions, turf issues do not seem to be part of their motivation. They are responding to student complaints, audit findings, and the results of Senate hearings about institutions. Over the past couple years there has been increasing concern by the Senate and the U.S. Department of Education about how federal financial aid dollars are spent at some institutions. Both the Senate and the Department have raised concern about the accrediting community&rsquo;s role in assuring quality and the states&rsquo; role in assuring consumer protection. The Department is not saying that it will go by state laws, which have been enforced unevenly. Therefore, the new federal rules are not based upon &ldquo;turf protection&rdquo; and we hope that states do not see this as an opportunity to erect unreasonable barriers.</p> <h2>What is the penalty if my institution does not comply with these regulations?</h2> <p>These regulations are all tied to federal financial aid.

111,State and Federal Regulations on 'State Authorization' of Distance Education,/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/talking-points,"<p><strong>The State Regulations</strong><br /> The state regulations predate the federal regulation and remain in effect. Neither the Court orders nor any pending federal action changes the fact that states expect institutions to follow their laws. States with regulations expect that your institution obtain the necessary approvals before advertising or serving students in their state.</p> <h2>What is the history of the STATE regulations?</h2> <p>States have long had the authority to regulate institutions offering education within the state's boundaries, regardless of the educational modality (face-to-face, distance, other) being used. States&#39; regulations vary from having no regulation to having very strict requirements. Even if you have no physical presence, a few states still expect you to comply. The definition of &quot;presence&quot; varies widely.</p> <p><strong>The Federal Regulation</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter 34, &sect;600.9 (c)</strong></p> <p><strong>Now Vacated and Not Enforced</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;If an institution is offering postsecondary education through <strong>distance or correspondence education</strong> to students in a State in which it is <strong>not physically located</strong> or in which it is otherwise subject to State jurisdiction as determined by the State, the institution <strong>must meet any State requirements</strong> for it to be legally offering distance or correspondence education in that State. An institution must be able to <strong>document to the Secretary</strong> the State&#39;s approval upon request.&quot;</p> <h2>What is the history of the FEDERAL regulation?</h2> <p><strong>October 2010</strong> - The U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) <a href=""http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-26531.pdf p. 66866"" target=""_blank"">released its regulation</a> (see below) requiring institutions to document that they have the proper approval to serve students in other states. Subsequently, the USDOE issued two &#39;Dear Colleague&#39; letters to help clarify the regulation.</p> <p><strong>July 2011</strong> - The U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia <a href=""https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2011cv0138-28"" target=""_blank"">&#39;vacates&#39; the regulation on procedural grounds</a>. The USDOE appealed the ruling.</p> <p><strong>June 2012</strong> - The U.S. Court of Appeals affirms the USDOE&#39;s ability to issue the regulation, which had been contested by the complainant. The Court <a href=""http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/969CEC5FCB92F81685257A14004F3131/$file/11-5174-1377087.pdf"" target=""_blank"">upholds the District Court&#39;s ruling to vacate the regulation</a> on procedural grounds.</p> <p><strong>July 2012</strong> - USDOE announces it will &quot;<a href=""http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1213.html"" target=""_blank"">not enforce the requirements</a> of 600.9 (c), although institutions continue to be responsible for complying with all State laws as they relate to distance education.&quot;</p> <p><strong>March 2013</strong> - Since July, WCET has sought clarification on several points from the USDOE on their announcement. Since the Court rulings vacated 600.9(c) on procedural grounds, the USDOE could simply reissue the regulations. Will the USDOE re-implement it? The USDOE has not decided, due to leadership openings not yet being filled.</p> <h2>What does &quot;operating,&quot; &quot;physically located,&quot; or &quot;physical presence&quot; in a state mean?</h2> <p>These definitions vary greatly from state to state. Many states require almost no institutions to apply for authorization, while others require almost every institution to apply. In the majority of states, the need to seek authorization depends on the specific combination of that state&#39;s laws and the activities that the institution is conducting in that state. For many states, if all you are doing in the state is offering distance education courses, you will not need to apply. However, if you are also conducting any one of a list of &quot;trigger&quot; activities (e.g., advertising in local media, using direct advertising, requiring local proctors, employing faculty or marketers in that state, conducting internships or practica in the state), you could be required to apply. The list of &quot;trigger&quot; activities varies by state.</p> <h2>Is there a state-by-state list of regulatory agencies?</h2> <p>The State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) organization <a href=""http://sheeo.org/projects/state-authorization-postsecondary-education"" target=""_blank"">profiles of regulations</a> of more than 70 agencies (some states have more than one).</p> <h2>What about reciprocal agreements between states?</h2> <p>The Presidents&#39; Forum and the Council of State Governments created a <strong>&quot;model&quot;</strong> State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). Based on that &quot;model,&quot; the regional higher education compacts (WICHE, SREB, NEBHE, and MHEC) created an <strong>&quot;implementation&quot; </strong>version of SARA. The Commission on Regulation of Postsecondary Distance Education is a committee formed by SHEEO and APLU to address authorization issues. In April 2013, they will release a final report. Their report is heavily based upon the work of the other two efforts. All of these groups now support the Commission&#39;s document. Reciprocity implementation will be a joint effort of the four regional higher education compacts. See the <a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization"">most recent documents</a>.</p> <h2>What if we do not comply?</h2> <p>For state regulations, there are often &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; orders and fines. Typically, a state&#39;s first steps are to work with the institution to bring it into compliance or to have it stop serving students in a state. Students could file lawsuits against institutions that have not received the proper local approval and did not notify the student.</p> <p>If the USDOE reinstates its regulation, institutions found not to be in compliance will be asked to reimburse federal financial aid funds for students in the non-compliant states. The USDOE still has its new <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=703a0de3f1a6dccfb54976fd595880ac&amp;rgn=div6&amp;view=text&amp;node=34:3.1.3.1.34.6&amp;idno=34"" target=""_blank"">&quot;misrepresentation&quot; regulation</a>, which requires institutions to disclose its authorization status to students in a state.</p> <p>WCET Updates on State Authorization</p> <ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization"">Website with updates.</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">WCET blog with updates and recommendations.</a></li> </ul> <p>WCET&#39;s State Authorization Team</p> <ul> <li><a href=""mailto:rpoulin@wiche.edu?subject=State%20Authorization"">Russ Poulin</a>.</li> <li><a href=""mailto:marianne@nchems.org?subject=State%20Authorization"">Marianne Boeke.</a></li> </ul> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/talking-points/WCET-TalkingPoints-State-Auth-04-08-2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Download the PDF</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",249,

It is not.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The US ED is NOT enforcing the state authorization regulation</strong>. Due to the Court order, the <a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/usdoe-will-not-enforce/Department%20cannot%20enforce%20%C2%A7%20600.9(c)"" target=""_blank"">Department cannot enforce <strong>&sect;</strong> 600.9(c)</a>. Therefore the previous deadline of <strong>July 1, 2014 is no longer going to be enforced.</strong></li> <li><strong>State Regulations Are Still in Place</strong>. The state regulations predated federal regulation <strong>&sect;</strong> 600.9(c). Those regulations are unaffected by the rulings and are still in force. There is now heightened awareness that institutions are operating in states without authorization. WCET advocates that institutions seek approval in states where they serve students regardless of the federal rule being struck down.</li> </ul> <h2>Additional Topics of Interest</h2> <ul> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization"" target=""_blank"">State Authorization--An Introduction.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/requirements"" target=""_blank"">Requirements for States.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/requirements"" target=""_blank"">Requirements for Institutions.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/requirements"" target=""_blank"">Defining &#39;Operate&#39; and &#39;Not Physically Located&#39;.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/getting-started"" target=""_blank"">Getting Started.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/getting-started"" target=""_blank"">State-by-State Lists of Regulations.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/complaints"" target=""_blank"">Student Complaints.</a></h3> </li> <li> <h3><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/reciprocal-agreements"" target=""_blank"">Reciprocal Agreements.</a></h3> </li> </ul> <h2>Compiled by:</h2> <p><img alt=""Russel Poulin"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Poulin-Russ.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <p>Russell Poulin</p> <p>Interim Co-Executive Director</p> <p>Deputy Director, Research and Analysis</p> <p>WCET - WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies</p> <p><a href=""mailto:rpoulin@wiche.edu?subject=State%20Authorization%20Network"">rpoulin@wiche.edu</a></p> <p>Phone: (303) 541-0305</p> <p><img alt=""Marianne Boeke"" src=""/sites/default/files/inline-images/images/associates/Boeke-Marianne.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:100px"" /></p> <p>Marianne Boeke</p> <p>Senior Research Associate, NCHEMS</p> <p><a href=""mailto:marianne@nchems.org?subject=State%20Authorization%20Network"">marianne@nchems.org</a></p> <p>Phone: (303) 497-0357</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>NOTE:&nbsp;This information is not endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education.

In the majority of states, the need to seek authorization depends on the specific combination of that state&#39;s laws and the activities that the institution is conducting in that state. For some of these states, if you are only offering distance education courses in the state, you will not need to apply. However, if you are also conducting any one of a list of &quot;trigger&quot; activities (i.e., advertising in local media, advertising directly to prospective students, using local proctors, employing faculty or marketers locally), you could be required to apply.
