2,Emerging Technologies,/focus-area/emerging-tech,"<h2>Emerging Technologies</h2> <p>The pace of change in the educational technology marketplace is constantly increasing. Higher education professionals likely adopt new technologies more quickly and easily for personal use than for applying them in effective ways to improve learning and student engagement. In addition to our own research, WCET builds upon the experiences of its innovative institutional members to crowd source how institutions are evaluating, supporting, and utilizing emerging technologies to advance teaching and learning.</p> <p>Issues We Are Following</p> <p><em><strong>Find WCET resources and more&hellip;</strong></em></p>  <ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/emerging-tech/badges"" target=""_blank"">Badges</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/emerging-tech/mobile-learning"">Mobile Learning</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=""/focus-areas"">&laquo; All Focus Areas</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",162,"7,8"

4,Managing E-Learning,/focus-area/managing-elearning,"<h2>Managing e-Learning</h2> <p>As new innovations emerge each year, demand for technology-mediated instruction expands, and e-learning grows in strategic importance in higher education, the biggest challenge for WCET members is managing change. Through its Managing Online Education survey, questions posed to the email list, e-Learning Consortia Common Interest Group, and focused projects, WCET explores the varied solutions that e-learning leaders use to meet the challenge. WCET members are open to collaborating and sharing their lessons learned so that others can build on that experience.</p> <p>Issues We Are Following</p> <p><em><strong>Find WCET resources and more&hellip;</strong></em></p>  <ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/managing-elearning/third-party-providers"">Third-party Providers</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=""/focus-areas"">&laquo; All Focus Areas</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",175,9
5,Policy and Regulation,/focus-area/policy-and-regulation,"<h2>Policy and Regulations</h2> <p>WCET helps members understand the governmental laws and regulations that have a direct impact on institutions that offer distance or technology-mediated learning. WCET follows emerging federal, state, and provincial regulations and seeks to help shape those proposals before they are enacted. Once those regulations are in place, WCET helps to interpret the requirements in understandable language and determine what methods institutions are using to comply. WCET also works with governmental officials to help them understand the impact the regulations have in the field.</p> <p>Issues We Are Following</p> <p><em><strong>Find WCET resources and more&hellip;</strong></em></p>  <ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization"">State and Federal Regulations on State Authorization of Distance Education</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/accessibility"" target=""_blank"">Accessibility</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=""/learn/focus-areas"">&laquo; All Focus Areas</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",166,"10,11"
6,Student Success,/focus-area/student-success,"<h2>Student Success</h2> <p>Student success in e-learning is the overarching goal of WCET and the higher education institutions and organizations that form the cooperative&#39;s membership. Student success is critical for so many reasons - producing graduates with the skills that will transfer to the workplace, driving institutional accountability for and commitment to student persistence, building institutional reputation among non-traditional consumers of postsecondary education, helping students to manage their personal debt and more. As distance and online education have morphed into new forms of hybrid, blended and mobile learning, student success becomes a campus-wide challenge stretching across all academic and administrative units. WCET, through its community of dedicated higher education professionals, works to identify promising practices to advance student success in e-learning.</p> <p>Issues We Are Following</p> <p><em><strong>Find WCET resources and more&hellip;</strong></em></p><ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/student-success/academic-integrity"">Academic Integrity</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/student-success/competency-based-education"">Competency-based Education</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/student-success/learning-analytics"">Learning Analytics</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/student-success/prior-learning-assessment"">Prior Learning Assessment</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/student-success/student-authentication"" target=""_blank"">Student Authentication</a></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=""/focus-areas"">&laquo; All Focus Areas</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",165,"12,13,14,15,16"
