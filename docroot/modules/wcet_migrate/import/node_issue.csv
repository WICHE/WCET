However, ultimately, it is the institution&#39;s responsibility to be accountable to accreditors, students, faculty, and to the institution&#39;s overall reputation and brand. It is essential that institutional providers of online and distance education develop strong relationships and partnerships with any third-party providers.</p> <h2>Talking Points</h2> <ul> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/talking-points/Vendor-Best-Practices-Info.pdf"">How to Successfully Choose and Develop a Relationship with Vendors</a></li> </ul> <h2>Frontiers Blog</h2> <ul> <li><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/talking-points/Vendor-Best-Practice-Checklist.docx"" target=""_blank"">Steps in Forming a Good Partnership with Third Party Vendors</a></li> </ul> <h2>Additional WCET Resources</h2> <ul> <li><a href=""http://www.wcet.wiche.edu/wcet/docs/talking-points/VendorBestPracticeChecklist.docx"">Best Practice Checklist for Choosing and Working with Third Party Vendors</a></li> </ul>",134,,,http://www.educause.edu/research-publications/books/game-changers-education-and-information-technologies,Game Changers by Diana Oblinger,,,/sites/default/files/docs/talking-points/WCET-TalkingPoints-Vendor-Best-Practices-Info.pdf,How to Successfully Choose and Develop a Relationship with Vendors,,,,,,,,,http://www.wcetconference2013.wiche.edu/schedule.php?show=223,Outsourcing - Creating Great Partnerships,,,/sites/default/files/docs/talking-points/WCET-TalkingPoints-Vendor-Best-Practice-Checklist.docx,Best Practice Checklist for Choosing and Working with Third Party Vendors
10,State and Federal Regulations on State Authorization of Distance Education,/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization,"<h3>State Authorization of Out-of-State Institutions</h3> <p>Whether via distance education, practical experiences, or face-to-face, states expect that institutions obtain approval before enrolling students, advertising, marketing, or performing other regulated activities in their state. The requirements as to which activities require authorization, the application processes, and the costs to comply vary greatly from state-to-state.</p> <p>In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education issued a regulation tying an institution&#39;s ability to offer federal financial aid in a state to the institution being authorized in the student&#39;s state. The regulation was subsequently &quot;vacated&quot; by federal court ruling and is not currently being enforced. The Department is currently in the process of reinstating the regulation. Regardless of the status of the federal regulation, states still expect institutions to follow their laws and regulations.</p> <ul> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/history"" target=""_blank"">History of State Authorization</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/requirements"" target=""_blank"">State Approval Requirements</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/starter-list"" target=""_blank"">Getting Started with State Approval</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/samples"" target=""_blank"">Sample Letters, Complain Processes, and Webpages</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/complaints"" target=""_blank"">Student Complaints</a></li> <li><a href=""/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization/reciprocal-agreements"" target=""_blank"">Reciprocal Agreements</a></li> </ul>",66,,,"http://www.sheeo.org/stateauth/stateauth-home.htm,http://www.nc-sara.org/,https://www.ncsbn.org/4841.htm","SHEEO Surveys of State laws and Regulatory Practices,SARA: National Commission for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements,Nursing Prelicensure Distance Education Requirements from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing",,,/sites/default/files/docs/state-auth/State-Authorization-WCETTwo-pager-06-18-15.pdf,State and Federal Regulations on 'State Authorization' of Distance Education (July 2015),,,,,"/sites/default/files/docs/state-auth/WCET-UPCEA-SloanC-State-Authorization-Survey-Press-Release-March-2013.pdf,/initiatives/research/upcea-wcet-sa-survey","Colleges Moving Slowly Toward State Authorization Compliance or Opting Out of States (March 20, 2013),What are Institutions Doing (or Not Doing) about State Authorization (May 2014)","/events/webcasts/higher-education-reauthorization-act,/events/webcasts/whats-new-with-sara","The Upcoming Higher Education Act Reauthorization: Why the e-Learning Community Should Pay Attention (April 2014),What's New with SARA?

Competency-based programs offer the flexibility, defined outcomes which increase employability, and acceptance of prior learning that make them attractive to this burgeoning demographic.</p> <h2>WCET Videos</h2> <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMoUVYggd4dOwp_H0XLlX62cBinnpr-I-"">WCET Leadership Summit: Defining Alternative Pathways to Credentials Videos</a></p> <h2>WCET Publications</h2> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/events/summit/2014-All-Hands-On-Deck-Final.pdf"">All Hands on Deck: Ten Lessons from Early Adopters of Competency-Based Education</a></p> <h2>Additional WCET Resources</h2> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/resources/Competency-Based-Education-In-Depth-Resource-2014.pdf"">Competency-Based Education In-Depth Session Resource 2014</a></p> <h2>Frontiers Blogs</h2> <ul> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/wisconsin-flexible-option/"">Wisconsin&rsquo;s Flexible Option: A System Approach to Competency-Based Education</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/northern-arizona-university/"">Competency-Based Learning at Northern Arizona University (&amp; New USDOE Rules)</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/cbeinfoorg/"">Community Colleges Adapt to CBE for the Benefit of Their Students</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/u-pace/"">U-Pace: Building Student Success Through Content Mastery &amp; Proactive Support</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/ctuintellipath/"">Intellipath for MBA preparation</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/capella-university-flexpath/"">Capella University FlexPath​</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/summitdapc/"">Glimpse into WCET Leadership Summit: Designing Alternative Pathways to Credentials</a></li> </ul>",-,,https://www.youtu.be/jhStdLoLYdM?list=PLMoUVYggd4dO0_LPzZXX1BopQQryz25ny,http://www.bbbb.blackboard.com/CurrencyofHigherEducation,The Currency of Higher Education Credits and Competencies,http://www.feeds.delicious.com/wcet/competencybasedlearning,https://www.wcetblog.wordpress.com/category/competency-based-learning/feed/,,,,,/sites/default/files/docs/events/summit/2014-All-Hands-On-Deck-Final.pdf,All Hands on Deck: Ten Lessons from Early Adopters of Competency-Based Education,,,,,/events/summits/alternative-credentials-2014,WCET Leadership Summit: Designing Alternative Pathways to Credentials,http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMoUVYggd4dOwp_H0XLlX62cBinnpr-I-,WCET Leadership Summit: Defining Alternative Pathways to Credentials Videos,/sites/default/files/docs/resources/Competency-Based-Education-In-Depth-Resource-2014.pdf,Competency-Based Education In-Depth Session Resource 2014

The growth in enrollments and in the number of educational providers of online learning fueled concerns about the ability of institutions to verify the identity of online students throughout the cycle of an online course: registration, participation, assessment, academic credit. Passage of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, followed by federal rule making, resulted in new regulations. One regulation required accrediting agencies to assure distance and correspondence education programs have processes in place to verify student identity. WCET has led a number of important efforts aimed at informing policy makers, accrediting agency leaders, and online program administrators of different approaches - pedagogical as well as technological - that ensure their compliance with the regulation but also raise the conversation to a more widely relevant discussion of academic integrity.</p> <h2>Frontiers Blog</h2> <ul> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/financial-aid-fraud/"" target=""_blank"">Proposed Safeguards Against Financial Aid Fraud: Some Needed, Some Go Too Far</a></li> <li><a href=""http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/test-proctoring-an-old-solution-to-a-reemerging-problem/"" target=""_blank"">Test Proctoring: an Old Solution to a (Re)Emerging Problem</a></li> </ul> <h2>Webcasts</h2> <ul> <li><a href=""http://bvirtualinc.com/webcast-follow-up-panel-discussion-guarding-the-future-of-online-learning-through-student-authentication-and-proctoring/"" target=""_blank"">Guarding the Future of Online Learning through Student Authentication and Proctoring</a></li> <li><a href=""http://www.learninghouse.com/connect2013/downloads/Connect2013_TacklingStudentAuthentication.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Tackling Student Authentication</a></li> </ul> <h2>Additional WCET Resources</h2> <p><a href=""/sites/default/files/docs/publications/Briefing-Paper-Feb-2008.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Are Your Online Students Really the Ones Registered for the Course?</a></p>",97,,,http://www.ncta-testing.org/cctc/,Consortium of College Testing Centers of the National College Testing Association,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.bvirtualinc.com/webcast-follow-up-panel-discussion-guarding-the-future-of-online-learning-through-student-authentication-and-proctoring/,http://www.learninghouse.com/connect2013/downloads/Connect2013_TacklingStudentAuthentication.pdf","Guarding the Future of Online Learning through Student Authentication and Proctoring,Tackling Student Authentication,","http://www.wcetconference2013.wiche.edu/search.php?tbCriteria=Academic+Integrity+Clarifications&x=0&y=0,http://www.slideshare.net/WCETConference2010/student-fraud?from_search=1","WCET 2013 Annual Meeting,WCET 2012 Annual Meeting",,,/sites/default/files/docs/publications/Briefing-Paper-Feb-2008.pdf,Are Your Online Student Really the Ones Registered for the Course?
